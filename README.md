# Job Tymr Rails App
# created by: Neil Burdick

## User Stories
My insiraption for this project came from when I was freelancing. I often wanted an easy service that would keep track of Jobs and the time I spent on them.
  Here is what I had in Trello for my User stories.
 * The User on entering the site is presented with a Log In form.
 * If the User has an account they can sign in.
 * If the User does not have an account they click a sign up button to go to the sign up form.
 * Once the User signs in the page is a list of all the Jobs the User has created.
 * If the User has no Jobs this will show instructions on how the site works. (This Feature was not Finished).
 * If the User is viewing all their Jobs they can add Time entries to the Job and the total time is shown.
 * The User is able to Edit a Job and Time entries.
 * When creating a new Time entry there is a timer that the User can start that will track how much time is spent. (This is another feature that is not yet implimented.)


 ##What I used to Create Job Tymr
  * Ruby On Rails was used
  * Postgresql was used for the Database
  * Devise was used for User login and authication.
  * Materialize css was ued for site styling.
  * I created the Job and Timer models using scaffold.
